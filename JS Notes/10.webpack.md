Out of the box, webpack won’t require you to use a configuration file. However, it will assume the entry point of your project is src/index.js and will output the result in dist/main.js minified and optimized for production.

you can use it like this :
```
./node_modules/.bin/webpack ./src/index.js --mode=development
```

Note : this command uses locally installed version of Webpack that is in my project's node_modules directory. If I want to run it like this:
```
webpack ./src/index.js --mode=development
```

this uses the global version of Webpack. If Webpack is not installed globally, this will result in a "command not found" error or some other issue because the shell can't find the global Webpack executable.

Install Webpack globally: You can install Webpack globally by running:
```js
npm install -g webpack webpack-cli
```

However if you don't want to install Webpack globally, you can always use the local version by referencing it with npx like this as well:
```
npx webpack ./src/index.js --mode=development

```

### Using webpack with a config file

Webpack is, however, much more flexible than that. We can change the entry point, adjust the output point and refine many other default behaviors by editing a configuration file which should be named as : webpack.config.js

here is an simple one : 

```js
# webpack.config.js

const path = require("path")

module.exports = {
  entry : "./src/entry",
  output : {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "output.js"
  }
}
```

create a file named as "webpack.config.js" and paste the code above.
then you can bundle your code using webpack using config file rather than the default values. you can run this command :

```
webpack --config ./webpack.config.js
```

but there is an important point here, it is very likely that you may get an error since if youe project consider every js file as es6 module rather than commonjs (since "type": "module", is added in your package.json)

Although Webpack does support ES6 modules in your application code(Means the code you're bundling can freely use import/export statements in source files). the webpack configuration file itself traditionally uses CommonJS syntax because it's a Node.js configuration file, not part of your application code.

This is similar to how package.json uses JSON syntax even though your project might use ES6 - different files serve different purposes and can use different syntax.

Therefore if you added "type": "module" in your package.json since it is more convenient, you can just change the extension of webpack config file from .js to .cjs. In this way node will consider your file as commonjs implementer.

therefore the code you are going to run should be like this :
```
webpack --config ./webpack.config.cjs
```
(also dont forget to change your file extension as well)


---
Also it is probably not a good idea (since it may not be easy to a foreigner or a contributor to understand what this file is in the first look)but if you want to change your config file name, you can just use the new name in your command :

```
webpack --config ./myconfigfile.cjs
```

---
Note : when you have config file, you can just run :
```
npx webpack
```
this will apply config file and bundle your code. If you dont have a config file and run this code, webpack apply the initial rules we discused in the beginning of this blog post.

---
Also it is good idea to assign this command as an npm script like that in your package.json so that you can just type "npm build" and your production ready js file will be ready in the output path you specified :

you may consider adding this into your package.json
```
"build" : "webpack --config webpack.config.cjs"
```

## Bundling html files 
src klasörümüze entry point js dosyamızın yanında bir de boilerplate'e sahip bir html dosyamızı koyarız. buna templeate html dosyası diyelim. "template.html". We do not need to put a script tag in this file! HtmlWebpackPlugin will automatically add our output bundle as a script tag.

önce şunu indirelim :
```
npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
```
Ardından config dosyamıza yapmamız gereken değişiklik : 
```js
// webpack.config.js
const path = require("path");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "main.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    clean: true,
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "./src/template.html",
    }),
  ],
}
```

bunu yaptıktan sonra artık build aldığımızda (npx webpack), /dist de hem bundle edilmiş js dosyamızı hem de bu dosyamızın script olarak eklendiği index.html dosyamızı göreceğiz. (hem de defer keyword ü ile eklenmiş)


## Bundling css 


download those 2 modules:
```
npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader
```
this is the final webpack config file :

```js
// webpack.config.js
const path = require("path");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "main.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    clean: true,
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "./src/template.html",
    }),
  ],
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
    ],
  },
};

```

now you can add your css files into src folder as well, but important point here is 

Modern bundlers (Webpack, Vite, Parcel, etc.) treat CSS as a module and require explicit imports. Therefore we should import css into out js file. it is just a side effect import (means when you import a module not for its exports, but just to ensure the code runs and has an effect.). This import doesn’t export anything—it simply tells the bundler (like Webpack or Vite) to process the CSS file and include it in the final build. 

import it like this :
```js
import "./styles.css";
import { greeting } from "./greeting.js";

console.log(greeting);
```

now you can bundle everyting by running npx webpack. then open your html file in the browser and see your code in production.


But note that this css bundling wont use <link> tag on the html. (you can bundle, open and see your html file).

Webpack imports css dynamically, not putting it as raw on the js like this :

```js
.p { color: blue; }
console.log("hello");

```
but like this :

```js
// Bundled JS file
const style = document.createElement("style");
style.textContent = ".p { color: blue; }";
document.head.appendChild(style);

console.log("hello");
```

Why this is the case : Still is it possible to add css using <link> tag on html file (by using MiniCssExtractPlugin). In the real world, projects often contain many moving parts and many modules. Eventually, it becomes easier to work with multiple smaller CSS files that you import in the modules they’re needed. There are even ways those files can be scoped only to those modules and not globally!


## Bundling images 

As you know, we can add images into :
- css files, using url() 
- html files, using <img>
- javascript files, accessing file path

and for each of them bundling requires some work to do,

for 1 : fortunately, css-loader module we downloaded while bundling css would do this. no need to do extra

for 2 : download `html-loader` first  and add below code to the modules.rules array

```
npm install --save-dev html-loader
```

```js
{
  test: /\.html$/i,
  loader: "html-loader",
}
```



for 3 : do not need to install any more module. Just add the following object to the modules.rules array and then, in whatever JavaScript module we want to use that image in, we just have to default import it, since bundler should know the exact file path for that image.

add this to modules.rules : 

```js
{
  test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
  type: "asset/resource",
}
```
import the images into your js : 
```js
import odinImage from "./odin.png";
   
const image = document.createElement("img");
image.src = odinImage;
   
document.body.appendChild(image);
```

## final config file

this is the final version of out config file became after making it able to bundle html, css, js and images :

```js
// webpack.config.js
const path = require("path");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "main.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    clean: true,
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "./src/template.html",
    }),
  ],
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
      {
        test: /\.html$/i,
        loader: "html-loader",
      },
      {
        test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
        type: "asset/resource",
      },
    ],
  },
};

```

## bothered to run "npx webpack" every time

as we mentioned, we bundle a lot of stuff, html, css, js, images etc. and even doing a small change in any of them requires a bundling again. to make it automatic, we can use webpack-dev-server which is prretty similar to Live Preview VSCode extension if you are using.


first install this module : 
```
npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server
```

then we need to do some configration on our config files:
- we are going to add a source map by eval-source-map as a devtool
- adding out template.html into the the dev server’s array of watched files. (webpack-dev-server will only auto-restart when it detects any changes to files we import into our JavaScript bundle, so our HTML template will be ignored!)

here the final final version of our config file with webpack-dev-server :
```js
// webpack.config.js
const path = require("path");
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "main.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    clean: true,
  },
  devtool: "eval-source-map",
  devServer: {
    watchFiles: ["./src/template.html"],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: "./src/template.html",
    }),
  ],
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        use: ["style-loader", "css-loader"],
      },
      {
        test: /\.html$/i,
        loader: "html-loader",
      },
      {
        test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
        type: "asset/resource",
      },
    ],
  },
};

```

now you can run this command that will host our web page on `http://localhost:8080/` :
```
npx webpack serve
```

enjoy it
