# Elements and Tags 

Hmtl element means : tags + content

```html
<p>some text content</p>
```
most of the elements has both opeining and closing tags, some may be void that doesnt have closing tags,
they are called void since they dont have content init like `<br>` or `<img>`. 


# HTML Boilerplate 

This is the boilerplate for the html file :
```html
<DOCTYPE! html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta >
        <title> Seen on the tab </title>
    
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1> Hello World! </h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

DOCTYPE declaration is for the browser understand which html version is this code should interpreted.

html is the root element

head and body are the necessary parts

head keeps the important meta-information about our webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly in the browser.
