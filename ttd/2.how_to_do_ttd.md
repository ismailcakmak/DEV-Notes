And the three steps follow on from the two rules:

```
1.Red—write a little test that doesn’t work, perhaps doesn’t even compile at first

2.Green—make the test work quickly, committing whatever sins necessary in the process

3.Refactor—eliminate all the duplication created in just getting the test to work1 
```
